# ReactMarkets 
Finance app made with React, Styled Components, Firebase, FinancialModelingPrep API and Currents API

## React
About React, I used Context API, Hooks, Error Boundaries, React.lazy and the relevant lifecycle methods to mount, unmount and update the app.

## Firebase
I used Firebase auth to sign in and sign up the user

## FinancialModelingPrep API
I used it to get the stock data, and chart data. To show charts, I chose Recharts library. But in the future, I might try google charts (material) to be able to style the chart myself (labels and axis)

## Current API
Currents API is to get news about stocks that are added to portfolio by the user. So in the profile page, I am showing news about each stock if the user is logged in and has stocks in their portfolio.
